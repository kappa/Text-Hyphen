Text-Hyphen

Text::Hyphen module is the implementation of the famous Knuth-Liang
algorithm to hyphenate words in text. That means using this module you
can determine positions inside words where it is possible to insert
a hyphen to break a line of text.

The algorithm is thoroughly documented in Franklin Mark Liang's Ph.D. thesis
available on CTAN (e.g. http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf) and is used
in TeX. The interesting property of this algorithm is that it isn't
based on a set of rules but instead uses a sophisticatedly compressed dictionary of patterns.
The original Knuth patterns for English are in public domain and
included with this implementation.

The Text::Hyphen distribution does not have any dependencies and will
probably work on old perls.

This is 0.11 version.
